Now given a sequence of insertions, you are supposed to tell the root of the resulting AVL tree.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. 
For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N (â‰¤20) which is the total number of keys to be inserted. 
Then N distinct integer keys are given in the next line. 
All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print the root of the resulting AVL tree in one line.

Sample Input 1:
5
88 70 61 96 120

Sample Output 1:
70

Sample Input 2:
7
88 70 61 96 120 90 65
